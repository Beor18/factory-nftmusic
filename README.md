# Whitepaper - Tuneport

## ðŸŽµ Introduction

Tuneport is a Web3 music platform where musicians upload their songs, can distribute revenue with or without collaborators, and sell to their fans, preserving their creative sovereignty. Tuneport eliminates intermediaries, improves revenue, and enables experiences like remixes, collectible fragments, and tokenized playlists.

## ðŸ§­ Motivation & Vision

Our goal is to establish the technical and philosophical foundation of the blockchain music ecosystem. We are defining the standard for how Web3 music platforms should balance innovation with usability, sovereignty with accessibility, and profitability with artistic integrity.

Tuneport serves as both a functional platform and an open blueprintâ€”demonstrating that music NFTs can be more than mere speculation, that streaming can coexist with ownership, and that complex revenue distribution can execute frictionlessly on the blockchain in a scalable manner.

We are charting the path from Argentina to the world, proving that the future of music is not only decentralizedâ€”it is artist-centered, fan-focused, and built on scalable infrastructure.

## âœ¨ Problem

- Artists earn pennies per thousands of plays.
- They cannot monetize remixes or playlists.
- Current Web3 platforms lack streaming, good UX, and scalability.

## ðŸ’¡ Tuneport Solution

- On-chain splits.
- Interactive streaming: minting of fragments, remixes, playlists.
- Frictionless onboarding (email or wallet thanks to Privy).
- Uninterrupted streaming on mobile and web.
- Modular architecture deployed on Base with gasless minting.
- If Tuneport doesn't exist, the artist can continue using the smart contracts with complete freedom and without intermediaries.

## ðŸš€ Smart Contract Features

MusicNFTFactory.sol

- Creation of music collections with mint start/end dates.
- Minting with ETH or ERC20 tokens.
- Optional: free mint for holders or fans.
- Royalties.

MusicCollection.sol

- Custom ERC1155 implementation for audio.
- Individual IPs per track or fragment.
- Integration with RevenueShare for automatic payments.
- RevenueShare & RevenueShareFactory
- Configurable splits for primary and secondary revenue.
- Support for inheritance in remixes and playlists.
- Cascade tracking.
- Roles for manager, artist, and collaborators.
- Payments in ETH or ERC20.

## ðŸ”„ Operational Flow

- The artist launches a collection.
- Configures royalties, dates, and splits.
- Users mint, remix, or create playlists.
- RevenueShare distributes payments according to logic
- If there are remixes or playlists, part of the revenue is inherited towards the original artist

## âœ¨ Differentiators

- Remixable NFTs.
- Tokenized playlists.
- Albums, collective drops, and singles as NFT collections
- Streaming (without broken crypto UX).
- Gasless integration with Privy (smart wallets without seed phrase).
- Monetization from every interaction.
